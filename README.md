## Troubleshooting

### Known Issues

#### Asteroids Deletion Inconsistency

**Issue:**
Asteroids are getting deleted when they reach the halfway point of the screen instead of when they go completely off-screen.

**Possible Cause:**
This issue may be related to the logic responsible for detecting when an asteroid should be deleted.

**Solution/Workaround:**
If you encounter this issue, consider reviewing the asteroid deletion logic in the code. 
Ensure that the condition for asteroid deletion is based on its position going completely 
off-screen rather than reaching the halfway point.

#### Score Incrementation Issue

**Issue:**
The score is getting incremented when asteroids are deleted in the middle of the screen, 
contrary to the expected behavior of incrementing the score only when asteroids go completely off-screen.

**Possible Cause:**
This issue may be due to the scoring logic being triggered at the wrong point in the asteroid lifecycle.

**Solution/Workaround:**
To address this issue, check the scoring logic in the code. Make sure that the score is incremented only when an asteroid is successfully navigated off-screen. Adjust the scoring logic accordingly.

## Future Features and Enhancements

I have exciting plans for the future development of this game! Here are some features and enhancements that I plan to add:

### Power-Ups

I'm working on introducing power-ups to enhance the gaming experience. Power-ups will provide players with unique abilities, such as invincibility, speed boosts. 
Stay tuned for updates on when these power-ups will be implemented!

### Leaderboard

A leaderboard system is in the pipeline to track and display the top scores of players. 
Compete with others and see how your skills compare to the rest of the gaming community. 
I'm actively working on implementing this feature to make the game even more competitive and enjoyable.
